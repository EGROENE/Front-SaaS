# Front-SaaS
This is a front-end project I created as part of the Devslopes Academy curriculum. I built a real homepage for a fictional software-as-a-service company. The only languages I used were HTML & CSS.
The logos of companies that I used do not belong to me; I used them for purely academic reasons as they were provided to me by Devslopes Academy.
